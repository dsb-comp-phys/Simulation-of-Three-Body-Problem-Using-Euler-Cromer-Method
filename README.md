# Simulation-of-Three-Body-Problem-Using-Euler-Cromer-Method

Designed a simulation of the three-body problem based on the Euler-Cromer method in MATLAB, simulating the Sun, Earth, and Jupiter. A variety of different masses were assigned to each of the three bodies to experiment with the simulation.
